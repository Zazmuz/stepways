\problemname{Step Ways}
You are walking down the stairs of your office, since you walk up and down every day you have counted there to be
exactly \(N\) steps. When you walk down the stairs you can either take one step or two steps at a time.
Bored as you are and to keep your mind occupied, you realize there are many ways to walk down the stairs.
If you have 4 steps you can walk down the stairs in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1-1-1-1
\item 1-2-1
\item 2-1-1
\item 1-1-2
\item 2-2
\end{itemize}
